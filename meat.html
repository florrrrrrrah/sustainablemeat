        <h1>Could Future Meat Alternatives Help Us Achieve Sustainability?</h1>
        <h2><a href="www.linkedin.com/in/chiayu-wang"><b>Chiayu Wang</b></a>, last updated on JULY 15 2024</h2>

    <p>As the global population becomes increasingly aware of the environmental and health impacts of meat
        consumption, the demand for sustainable solutions appears to be declining in the UK, particularly following
        the COVID-19 pandemic. What stops consumers from taking in meat alternatives? Are there any other future
        choices could help us achieve sustainability?</p>

    <h3>
        <p>Way Back into Meat as Flexitarians Decrease</p>
    </h3>

    <p>A growing number of people in the UK are reducing their meat consumption for health and environmental causes. A
        survey by the <a href="https://smartproteinproject.eu/">Smart Protein</a> project on dietary lifestyles shows
        that 48% of British people cut down on meat
        intake in 2023, an increase of 11% compared to 2021.</p>

    <p>Instead of going vegetarian or vegan directly, some people are adopting a <b>flexitarian</b> diet on a trial
        basis.
        Flexitarians actively incorporate plant-based meals into their diet while also embracing some meat and other
        animal foods in moderation, a practice also known as <b>casual vegetarianism</b>.</p>

    <p>However, the latest statistics suggest a slightly reverse trend in the UK. Britons appear to be falling back in
        love with meat again and leave their flexitarian diet behind.</p>

    <!-- dietary lifestyle -->

        <script src="dietary.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>The proportion of flexitarians reached its highest
        at 16% in 2022 but shortly reverted to the previous levels. In contrast, the figure of meat eaters has been
        steadily increasing since 2021, while the percentages of vegan, vegetarian, and pescetarian diets have remained
        relatively low over the last five years.</p>

    <h3>
        <p>Protein Competition Intensifies BUT Market Facing Downturns</p>
    </h3>

    <p>This flexible dietary change previously gave rise to the rapid development of meat alternatives, which offer
        supplemental nutrients for vegan and vegetarian meals.</p>

    <p>According to the Good Food Institute, the UK ranks Europe’s second biggest market of plant-based meat and had the
        third highest average consumption in 2022. The Meat alternative sector is also the most developed among all
        categories in the UK plant-based food market, reaching £474.5 million in revenue during the same period.</p>

    <p>Even so, recent research by Mintel reveals a continuous decline in the value and volume of meat alternatives
        since 2022, after the market enjoyed strong growth amid the COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>

        <script src="sale.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>Retail sales of meat alternatives in the UK dropped 4% in 2023, following a failing 2022 with revenue declines of
        6.8%. In terms of quantity, meat alternatives sold remained to decrease in both years, facing downturns of over
        12% consecutively. The recession is expected to persist until 2026, in which the meat alternatives market may
        regain its momentum.</p>

    <p>Quorn, the UK’s leading brand in meat alternatives, encountered similar stagnation, reporting <a
            href="https://meatmanagement.com/?s=alternative">a 4% revenue
            decline earlier this year attributed to “continued category softness”</a>.</p>

    </div>

    <p>A Quorn spokesperson explains: “The market has been inundated with new product and brand launches in recent
        years, and these have not always kept shoppers coming back.” Quorn aims to address consumers’ major
        concerns—affordability and taste—when it comes to purchasing meat alternatives.</p>

    <p>The declining sales and consumption is predominantly a result of inflation and rising prices post-pandemic,
        despite the ongoing trend of eating sustainably for future generations. According to Statista, 2021 marked a
        turning point for the meat alternative market. It saw the fastest growth by 23.5% in consumption and the average
        price dropped to its lowest.</p>

    <!-- price & consumption -->
    <div class="graph">
        <svg id="price"></svg>
        <script src="price.js"></script>
    </div>

    <p>A stabilising trajectory emerged following the market’s success in 2021, with consumption reaching a higher level
        than in 2019 and the price staying at around £9. Price plays a crucial role in this market, significantly
        influencing consumption patterns. While the initial adoption of plant-based meat was strong, sustained high
        prices appear to have led to a plateau in future consumption.</p>

    <p>The rise of meat alternatives presents a long-term threat to the traditional meat market. ​​In 2022, plant-based
        meat prices increased by 4% on average, whereas pre-packaged conventional meat prices rose by 10%.</p>

    <p>The latest report from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) demonstrates that the average
        price of a main meal with meat alternatives is nearly double that of a meat-free meal, aligning closely with the
        costs of a meal containing traditional meat. Statistics also indicate that plant-based meat alternative products
        were 3.3% more expensive than their animal-based counterparts.</p>

    <p>Once the prices of meat alternatives drop and financial pressure eases, the appeal of sustainability is expected
        to drive 28% of processed meat buyers to consider consuming more plant-based meat products or protein-rich
        ingredients, according to a Mintel’s survey.</p>

    <p>In response to the growing trend towards green dietary choices, several global chain restaurants, including TGI
        Fridays and Taco Bell, have begun to embrace plant-based meat into their menu offerings.</p>

    <figcaption>London boasts a variety of vegan and vegetarian restaurants offering diverse culinary styles, including
        fast food and Chinese cuisine.</figcaption>

    <p>Temple of Seitan, one of London’s earliest established vegan fast food restaurants, further partnered with famous
        tofu brand Tofoo to launch chicken flavoured faux meat products in May.</p>

    <p>Anbessa Archibald has been working in the Temple of Seitan’s kitchen for over a year. He has not only observed an
        increase in vegan diners at the restaurant, but also noticed many tourists and omnivores giving seitan a try for
        the first time.</p>

    <p>As a vegan himself, Anbessa favours wholefoods in his diet and often prepares his own meat alternatives, tempeh,
        rather than purchasing them from the supermarkets due to limited choices. He explains: “One of the advantages of
        the seitan we offer in our restaurant is its high protein content, which provides essential nutrients for
        vegans, vegetarians, and even bodybuilders.”</p>

    <h3>
        <p>To A More Sustainable Dining Table</p>

    </h3>

    <p>Instead of solely eyeing on the traditional meat competitors and innovating their alternatives for vegan or
        vegetarian meals, Marco Bertacca, CEO of Quorn, is rethinking the future of their products following the
        downfall.</p>

    <p>“We now find ourselves collaborating to offer less-meat options to consumers who are looking to reduce meat
        consumption, but not eat vegetarian or vegan meals.” Bertacca says, noting this approach caters to the majority
        and presents a significant opportunity to reduce carbon emissions in the food system and improve public health.
    </p>

    <p>Another popular sustainable choice is claimed to be cultivated meat, also known as lab-grown meat, aims to
        effectuate
        meat production without having an animal slaughtered and emitting substantial carbon emissions.</p>

    <p>Ivy Farm Technologies, one of the earliest cultivated meat companies and sponsored by Oxford University, has
        successfully produced chicken, pork, beef, and even duck meat in laboratories.</p>

    <p>
        Riley Jackson, Partnerships and Marketing Manager at Ivy Farm Technologies describes the process: “Producing
        cultivated meat is similar to taking a cutting from a plant and providing it with all the nutrients and the
        environment to grow.” She emphasises the highly monitored and regulated nature of the process, dramatically
        reducing risks of contamination compared to traditional farming methods.</p>

    <p>Before joining Ivy Farm Technologies, Jackson also worked at a plant-based meat company. She acknowledges that
        “plant-based meat has come a really long way, but has not yet lived up to the promises of tasting as good or
        better than meat from a cow or a pig”.</p>

    <img src="supermarket2.jpg" class="s-img">

    <figcaption>Waitrose offers a wide range of plant-based meat products, while cultivated meat producers argue these
        options don't fully meet consumer needs.
    </figcaption>

    <p>Protein alternative has also become one of the UK government’s resort to achieve Net Zero goals. However, the
        controversy surrounding cultivated meat remains unsettled, with only three countries—Singapore, the
        US, and Israel—having approved it for human consumption.</p>

    <p>Ivy Farm Technologies, along with other cultivated meat companies, is collaborating closely with the UK
        government to secure approval from the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Jackson anticipates that cultivated meat
        will be officially approved in the UK <b>next year</b>, but acknowledges that it will take several more years
        for their
        products to be mass-produced and available on the market.</p>

    <p>While plant-based and cultivated meats offer promising solutions for reducing environmental impact, their success
        depends on overcoming current challenges such as cost and taste. To achieve sustainability by shifting dietary
        habits and reducing meat intake, safe meat alternative choices are proven to be what consumers need for cutting
        down carbon emission. </p>
